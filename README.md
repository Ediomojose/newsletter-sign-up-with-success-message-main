## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

This project focuses on building a newsletter form, that populate a sucess message as a pop-up. To implement this I use the HTML Modal Element which makes maipulation of pop-up modal easy, it also included a bit of javascript that triggers the pop-up modal to display when form is submitted.

Some of the basic functionality inplemented are:


- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
